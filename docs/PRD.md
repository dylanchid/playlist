# 🎯 Product Requirements Document - PlaylistShare
## Refined & Focused Version 2.0

---

## 1. Executive Summary

### Vision Statement
PlaylistShare is the first social music discovery platform built around trusted friend recommendations, where every playlist comes with personal context and musical connections transcend streaming platform boundaries.

### Mission
To solve music discovery fatigue by connecting friends through curated playlists with personal stories, creating meaningful musical relationships that algorithms can't replicate.

### Core Problem Statement
**The Problem**: Music lovers are overwhelmed by algorithmic recommendations but crave personal, contextual music discovery from trusted friends across different streaming platforms.

**The Solution**: A social platform where friends share playlists with personal context, enabling authentic music discovery through trusted relationships rather than faceless algorithms.

### Primary Success Hypothesis
*"Users will discover and engage with 3x more music when it comes with personal context from friends versus algorithmic recommendations."*

## 3. Competitive Analysis

### Direct Competitors
**Last.fm**
